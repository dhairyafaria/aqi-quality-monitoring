# aqi-quality-monitoring
It is an real time application for fetching real time AQI value for Indian cities.
Web sockets is being used to fetch the real time data from the source.
Also vuetify is used to import responsive table.
I have used Chart.js for showing Bar and Line chart. Charts are responsive too.
There are three routes Home, Charts and City.
I have used Vuex to store data, so that it can be accessed across components.

Time taken to develop this is 7 hours without prior knowledge of sockets and charts.
